Converters exist for TeX/LaTeX and Html/Mathml. Notice that TeXmacs is not based on TeX/LaTeX.</li><li>Its rendering engine uses high-quality typesetting algorithms so as to produce professionally looking documents, which can either be printed out or presented from a laptop.</li><li>New styles can be written by the user and new features can be added to the editor using the Scheme extension language.</li><li>Runs on all major Unix platforms, macOS, and Windows.</li></ul><p>Mogan Research inherits all the above features from GNU TeXmacs (see <a href="https://www.texmacs.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the homepage of GNU TeXmacs</a>), so it can also be used as a efficient study tool for students, teachers, and researchers in science and technology, and suitable to create high-quality assignment documents, report slides, and LaTeX-level papers.
