TeXmacs itself does not directly support DOCX, but it uses Pandoc as an intermediary for conversion. Therefore, ensuring that Pandoc is installed and that the path is correctly configured is a crucial step.</p><h3 id="installed-version-vs-portable-version-of-pandoc" tabindex="-1">Installed Version vs. Portable Version of Pandoc <a class="header-anchor" href="#installed-version-vs-portable-version-of-pandoc" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Installed Version vs. Portable Version of Pandoc&quot;">​</a></h3><p>It is recommended to use the installed version of Pandoc rather than the portable version (zip package). This is because the installed version of Pandoc automatically adds the executable path to the system&#39;s environment variables, allowing it to be called from any terminal or application. If you use the portable version, you will need to manually configure the environment variables, which may lead to TeXmacs not being able to find Pandoc, causing the export to fail.</p><p>For instructions on how to install the <code>Pandoc</code> plugin, please refer to <a href="./plugin_binary_pandoc.html">Pandoc Binary Plugin</a>.
